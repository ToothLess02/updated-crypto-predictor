# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project uses a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network** to predict cryptocurrency prices based on historical data. The model is trained using time-series data and features like **closing price, simple moving average (SMA), and exponential moving average (EMA)**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📈 **Predicts future cryptocurrency prices** based on historical data.
- 🧠 **Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for sequential data modeling.
- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing** with MinMaxScaler for normalization.
- 💾 **Saves and loads trained models and scalers using Pickle (.pkl) files**.
- 📊 **Visualizes results** with Matplotlib.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
In this project we have 3 files,
1. Crypto- This is a python file which prideicts the future graph
2. Crypto Sentiment Analysis- This is a python file which scans posts from reddit and scans it to provide data tht wheater we should invest or not
3. Crypto Prediction Website- This is a website which has the predictor in built in it.
