Please correct me if I am wrong but its my understanding that at the exchange level (Coinbase, Crypto(.)com etc.) your seed phrase and private keys are held by the exchange and therefore you do not own the crypto you purchased.  It's all my understanding that with a hot wallet (Exodus, Trust etc.) you have access to your seed phrase and private keys so you have complete access to your purchased crypto.  My question is with cold wallets (Ledge, Trezor, etc.) and how are they different than a hot wallet.  If you can use your seed phrase to gain access to your digital wallet from your cold wallet device doesn't that hashed seed phrase need to be stored online?  A friend of mine involved with this conversation asked if all you need is the seed phrase to gain access to a wallet then a cold wallet is no more secure than a hot wallet. Another question I have is do cold wallets store your crypto coins on them, if so how does that get back to the block chain to record the movement of said crypto.  Thanks all sorry for the newbie questions I am about to deep dive this so I can be clear when I tell them why a cold wallet is more secure than a hot wallet.  \n",

            "long term crypto follower here. There is a strange phenomenon in the crypto world which always repeat itself. You would guess people would learn from the past but no. People always chasing the next hype coin... and create a cult around it. We saw what happened with SafeMoon. Nowadays it's a new coin called Pi Network. A click-a-button-mine-coins thing. The whole project is based on a feature where you have to press a button once in 24 hours to \"mine\" coins. And you are \"mining\" more when you invite your friends and families... Additionally you do not have immediate access to your coins. First you need to KYC and get approval from the Pi Network team. What an innovative thing! Still people are talking highly about this project and call it the next big thing and defend the project with everything they have. But it will be like always, people will lose a ton of money because they invest everything into a dream...I am really curious if this cycle will stop in the future but I doubt that.\n",
